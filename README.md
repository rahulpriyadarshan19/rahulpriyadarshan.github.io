### Research Projects

#### **Emulating a photodissociation region (PDR) code with deep learning (2nd master's thesis)**

In this work, I developed and trained a deep learning architecture based on Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (NeuralODE) to mimic/emulate the performance of an astrochemical modelling code, `3DPDR`. The network evaluates chemistry in photodissociation regions (PDR) about ~17000 times faster, and produces accurate predictions for many chemical species and temperatures.

#### **Interstellar Broadening with LOFAR (1st master's thesis)**
In this work, I measured the interstellar scattering effect that causes poorer resolution (broadening) of astronomical images at radio frequencies. I  found that broadening reduces with increasing radio frequencies, as expected. For more details, click here.
